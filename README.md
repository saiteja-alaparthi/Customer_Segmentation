# Customer_Segmentation


Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation for an automotive firm using the K-Prototypes clustering algorithm. The objective was to categorize new customers into four unique clusters (A, B, C, and D) based on behavioral trends. The K-Prototypes algorithm, which handles both categorical and numerical data, achieved an accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving segmentation consistency.
