# Customer_Segmentation


**Overview**

This project focuses on customer segmentation for an automotive firm using the K-Prototypes clustering algorithm. The objective was to categorize new customers into four unique clusters (A, B, C, and D) based on behavioral trends. The K-Prototypes algorithm, which handles both categorical and numerical data, achieved an accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving segmentation consistency.


**Features**

  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

   . Handled missing values using padding and logical inference.
  
   . Encoded categorical variables into numeric representations.
  
   . Removed unnecessary columns for better performance.

  Feature Engineering:

   . Added age categorization to group customers into age ranges.
    
   . Derived additional insights from spending scores, marriage status, and professions.

  Model Training:

   . Trained a K-Prototypes clustering model to group customers into 4 clusters.

  Visualization:

   . Generated pie charts and bar plots for cluster characteristics, including spending scores, marital status, and profession distribution.
